Hi! We are Kurum Inc., a company committed to solving societal challenges through technology.

We believe in shaping the future by writing code. This is not just about advancing technology, but about deeply considering what problems that technology should solve.

In this era, technology has become commoditized, and new frameworks and languages are born every day. However, what truly matters is how to utilize them to create solutions that make an impact in the world.

On this GitHub, we share the code that solves the difficult problems we face daily, with the aim of learning and growing together with all of you.

We are committed to discovering the true value that technology holds and harnessing it for the benefit of society. We invite you to join our challenges and help shape the future together.
